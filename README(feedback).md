- What was the challenge?
To create create a Jenkins pipeline that takes app and on every push to the repository, tests the app, creates the docker image and pushes the image to a Nexus repository.

- How I expected the challenge to go.
Based on material we studied during the week, I expected the challenge to be interesting and I would be able to solve new problems/errors based on my knowledge.

- What went well?
I managed to run all tests without getting an error with jenkins from github, and pushig it to nexus, where I have folders with files now. 

- What didn't go as planned?
I faced problems/errors that were difficult to eliminate based on the knowledge gained during the training. I consulted with the trainer about errors, and I also used additional materials to sort new errors by trial.

- Possible improvements for future challenges.
Study harder
